#    üß™ SIMULATOR PARAMETERS üß™   #

#=================================#

simulator:
  capital: 10000
  commission: 1
  simultaneous_positions: # variants to go through, could be multiple to consider
    - 4
  #  - 5
  failsafe_trigger_level: 0.15  # 15% to reach. Note: failsafe trigger is not actually used after thorough testing, remove
  failsafe_exit_level: 0.05  # 5% to throwback.

  ### Stop-related behaviour
  stop_loss_level: 0.1
  # stop loss to fully exit. this is calculated from the candle previous to entry day (when we have signal) low
  # ^^^ decimal representation e.g. 0.05 equals 5%
  # seems that 5% may be too conservative, needs further testing

  ### Filters to use
  numerical_filters:
    fisher_daily:
      min: -500
      max: 500
    fisher_weekly:
      min: -500
      max: 500

#        exit_proportion: 25%
#        move_stop_price: True
#        move_stop_from_tp_level: 5%  # this is a distance down from the take profit level (so if it pulls back X% from there)

#  - variant_name: "ultra_conservative"  # similar to the current approach
#    take_profit_values:
#      - level: 10%
#        exit_proportion: 100%

      # Output will contain TRAILING PROFIT HIT for trailing profit
      # STOP LOSS HIT for stop losses
